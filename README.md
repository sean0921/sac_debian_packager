### Download latest release of this script

```bash
wget https://github.com/sean0921/sac_debian_packager/releases/latest/download/script.tar.gz
tar -xvf script.tar.gz
```

or you can download [current `*.zip` archive of this repository](https://github.com/sean0921/sac_debian_packager/archive/master.zip) and extract it.

### Put downloaded SAC source tarball into cloned repo

```bash
cd sac_debian_packager-${VERSION_NUMBER}
cp ${LOCATION_OF_DOWNLOADED_TARBALL} ./              ## For example, cp ~/Download/sac-101.6a-source.tar.gz ./
```

### Install build dependencies

```bash
apt install build-essential libx11-dev libncurses-dev libreadline-dev autoconf automake autopoint autotools-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libxml2-dev pkg-config ### with root
```

### Run build scripts

change your current directory to this source code repo and:

```bash
./build.bash                          ## or you can type bash build.bash
```

### Install generated `*.deb` file

```bash
apt install ./sac-iris-*_amd64.deb    #### with root, you can change * to specific version number
```

### Done!

* Maybe you have to re-login the shell (for e.g., `bash -l`) or desktop for loading newer environment.

### Remove installed SAC package

```bash
apt remove sac-iris      ### with root
```

### Clean Build Directory before Rebuild

```bash
./build.bash --clean
```

## To Do

* Adding build dependencies package installing procedure to `build.bash`.
* ~~fix shellcheck warning~~
* ~~Add patch to fix wrong autoconf name (`configure.in` should be `configure.ac`), simplified duplicated patch.~~ (upstream fixed)
* ~~Pass the compilaion with `-fno-common` mode~~ (upstream fixed)
